PyArena, the game of Python developers. Some sort of things make people mad! Python is one of that kind.
Actually Python had nothing to do with snakes. But Beware, PyArena has. This is an arena of real pythons.
Pythons which are really dangerous, which bites and even squeeze to death. In the kingdom of Alice, in between the
hazardous pythons. Meant only for crazy and brave guys who really love python, who could make pythons to love
with, live with.

### HOW TO PLAY :
