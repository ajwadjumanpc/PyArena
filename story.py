    Hey Boss, 
    Hope you're brave enough in this Python's territory. Pythons can quite literally squeeze a human to death.
    If we study the past, we could say, almost none returned after entering this land. I don't know why it's so.
    But, there are stories of great lives who loved and turned python to fall in love with. Boss, I don't know whether
    any other ways to reach the palace. 
    
    Are you bored! You might be thinking, who this is... telling stories...
    I am Alice. I was princess of this kingdom. My Papa was a great pet lover. But it was strange to have pet like him.
    He did love it more than him. I think, It also did love back. But...
    Let's change topic or let's continue later...
    Boss, I think you can conquer...
    Trust Alice, You can...
